# This program takes a string as an input from a user and outputs a new string in the form of the popular mocking Spongebob Meme. For example, "Do your homework Savannah!" would return "do yOuR HoMeWoRk saVaNnAh!". I did this by changing the case of every even indexed number. This program is written using Python.
